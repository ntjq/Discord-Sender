# Discord-Sender
it's my first project so it's not that great

Discord Sender using discord webhook
can save the webhook to use it on another time 

to use it you just need to save your webhook first and you can send any message

it's simple you don't need to be genius to use it 

I don't think you will get any issue but if you get any problem or need any
help just tell me on discord - @ntjq
